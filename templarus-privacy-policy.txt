Privacy Policy

Absolutely no information is stored by, or retrieved from Templarus without express user interaction with the Templarus user interface. All information input by the user and saved in the Templarus user interface is stored in the app storage of Templarus on the user's own device. No other information, besides the information input by the user, is stored in the Templarus app storage on the user's device other than timestamps generated and stored with the information at the time the information is saved by the user. If the user wishes to remove any or all information stored by Templarus from their device they can either a) delete any or all contents using the app's user interface, or b) delete the app itself, which, according to the operating system's procedure, also removes the app storage. Furthermore, no information is retrieved from or sent outside of the Templarus user interface and app storage on the user's device (such as by network, or through inter-app communication) unless the user does so through built-in copy-paste commands or by interaction with the Templarus user interface export command. Doing so involves either a) copying any selected text and pasting, or b) using the export button in the Templarus user interface (or export key command when using a connected keyboard), which copies the selected contents or visible text to the operating system's pasteboard (the equivalent of selecting any text and copying it), readying the information to be pasted to any other text input area presented on the user's device (by Templarus or other apps).
